# Virtual-keyboard

This project features a virtual keyboard controlled by both hands using MediaPipe's Hand Tracking module. The eft hand's index finger is used to hover over virtual keys, while the right hand's thumb and index finger perform a tapping gesture to simulate key presses. MediaPipe detects and tracks both hands simultaneously in real-time. When the tapping gesture is detected on the right hand, the system captures the current key being pointed at by the left index finger, effectively simulating a press. This bimanual interaction improves accuracy and mimics natural typing behavior in a contactless way.
THANK YOU!
